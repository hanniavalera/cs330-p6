      <p> A wireframe prototype to redesign a fictional online book club app. </p>
      <p> This app allows users to maintain "bookshelves" of books that they want to read, are reading now, and that they've finished reading. </p>
      <p> They are able to add and remove books from the shelves, or move them from one shelf to another.</p>
      <p> Feedback was positive — the Teacher's Assistant remarked, "What's impressive is that you kept things minimal and clean, despite adding many nice features." </p>
