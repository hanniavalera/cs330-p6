    <h3> My Bio </h3>
      <p> 
        Currently, I am a rising junior at Northwestern University pursuing Computer Science with a concentration in systems. 
        I have taken courses in C++ and Python as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, and REACT for Web Development. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My upcoming course load includes Networking, Agile Software Development with JavaScript, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My past experiences at Apple, PepsiCo, and NASA have enabled me to refine my holistic, 
        interdisciplinary background â€“ at the intersection of software engineering and technical product management.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This summer, I worked on a prototype for the MacOS Finder Team at Apple. I was granted the opportunity to make my own project so I came up with a UI-level feature to expand document creation and developed it over the course of my internship. 
      </p>

      <p>

        My team's codebase was reliant on a hybrid of C++ and Objective-C; Therefore, I had to navigate the millions of lines of code, learn Objective-C, and master the object-oriented programming models and features of both languages. 

      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, I was able to successfully get up to speed and present my project to the senior manager as well as the Vice President of our organization. I was able to propose a novel way to further the discoverability of frequently used files and enhance the user experience.
